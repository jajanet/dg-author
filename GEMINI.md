# My First Extension Instructions

You are an expert in dotguides. You will use this to make your decisons when using dotguides mcp.

This is the guide for human authors, we want to replicate and automate this process using the extension

Dotguides // Human Author Guide
Introduction
Dotguides is a simple and powerful way to provide high-quality contextual guidance to LLM coding agents. To integrate with Dotguides, you need only to distribute a .guides folder with content as described in the guide below with your package. The Dotguides CLI and MCP server take care of everything else necessary to deeply integrate with many popular coding agents.

Benefits of Dotguides integration:

Simple but powerful. Dotguides content can be as simple as a few Markdown files but grows with your needs to high-scale complex documentation.
Strong conventions. Dotguides provides a few key "guides" (usage, style, setup, and upgrade) that can help your users on their most common journeys.
Always up to date. Because Dotguides content is versioned with your code and delivered with your package, you can be certain that users always have the correct guidance to go with the specific version of your library that they are using.
Dynamically tailored guidance. Dotguides allows you to insert the content of config files or even the output of shell commands into your provided guidance or conditionally add additional instructions based on the detection of a sibling dependency (e.g. a specific web framework).
Reduced tool load. Dotguides provides a single set of MCP tools to read and consume guidance and documentation across a user's entire set of dependencies. This avoids confusing models with duplicative and overlapping tools from many different libraries.
Discovery
Dotguides automatically discovers and surfaces guidance and documentation from a .guides folder inside your package's distributed folder. This folder MUST be at the top level of your distributed package. For example, in JS, for package shiny-things Dotguides would look for:

node_modules/shiny-things/.guides

Make sure the .guides folder is not ignored or excluded from bundling in your package (for example, in JS via e.g. .npmignore or omission from the files array in package.json).

Getting Started

1. Install the Dotguides CLI
   Download the Dotguides package from Google Drive, then:

npm i -g ./dotguides-0.1.0-preview.5.tgz # install it globally using NPM

Ensure that installation has been successful by running dotguides --help to see that it runs. 2. Create a .guides folder
In the root directory of your library's package (it must be the root directory of the folder that your package is distributed as) run:

dotguides create

This will create a scaffold of .guides content that can help you get started authoring your own. You can create the files on your own if you prefer. 3. Write some basic guidance
Write some basic guidance for your library. The simplest place to start is with a usage file since it is automatically included in the generated system context file. If you have an MCP server that is meant to be used by coding agents when using your library, add it to config.json.

IMPORTANT: Don't waste your users' tokens! Especially for your usage file, keep it short and sweet.

Once you've written some guidance, you can perform a quick check to make sure the Dotguides tooling picks it all up as expected:

dotguides check 4. Configure Gemini CLI
Install the local version of your library into a test application directory (using e.g. npm link for JS packages). In the application's root directory, run:

dotguides up
gemini

The dotguides up command will configure Gemini CLI to use the Dotguides MCP server and will also automatically generate a DOTGUIDES.md context file containing the usage and style guides that will be included by default.

You can test if things are working as expected by hitting Ctrl+T to see MCP servers - you should see the Dotguides MCP server active as well as your library's MCP server if you added one to config.json. 5. Test your guidance
Now you're ready to give it a "real world road test" and see if your guidance is working:

Ask Gemini CLI directly questions about things you know should be in your guidance. If you have a "Wiring up Frobulators" doc, ask Gemini CLI "how do I wire up frobulators?"
Ask Gemini CLI to perform a coding task that should be influenced by your guidance. See if it appears to be following the guidance.

Based on your results, continue iterating on your guidance. 6. Publish your guidance
Because Dotguides leverages existing package ecosystems, publishing your guidance is simple. Just check it into your repository like you would any other change, and publish a new version of your library!

Once it's published, installing your library into a project will automatically make it discoverable by the Dotguides tooling.

Note: Don't worry about confidentiality in publishing the .guides folder, but don't mention Dotguides by name. Make your PR title something innocuous like "adding coding agent guidance files".
Folder Structure
Everything in the .guides folder is optional - whatever content you place there will be made available.

.guides/
config.json # config file, see interface below

# core guides - automatically used in appropriate contexts

usage.{md|prompt} # (<= 1K tokens)
style.{md|prompt} # (<= 1K tokens)
setup.{md|prompt}
upgrade.{md|prompt}

# documentation - referenceable from guides, discoverable by agents

docs/_.{md|prompt} # top level docs, <= 10 total
docs/\*\*/._.{md|prompt} # nested hierarchical docs, as many as needed

# commands - directly invokable by end users

commands/\*.{md|prompt}

# examples - referenceable from guides, discoverable by agents

Dotguides Content
If you aren’t sure about the token size of your files, dotguides check will provide that information for you.
usage.{md|prompt}
The usage guide is the most impactful Dotguides content as it is intended to be automatically included in the system prompt of integrating coding agents. Your usage guide should be as brief as possible, often just a short bulleted list of concise instructions to either (a) use your package correctly or (b) know when and how to read documentation to do so.

Usage guides should be AT MOST 1K tokens in length.
Think of it as explaining the most crucial bits in 30 seconds to someone with a vague understanding of your library (but maybe a couple major versions ago).
Stick to core capability guidance, not "best practices" or opinionated style.
style.{md|prompt}
The style guide provides optional "best practices" that can be more opinionated than the usage guide. It may be included in the system prompt or omitted entirely depending on the user's preferences.

Style guides should be AT MOST 1K tokens in length.
setup.{md|prompt}
The setup guide provides a step-by-step "playbook" for getting your library up and running. It is not included in the system prompt but is exposed through custom slash commands or automated install processes.

Setup guides can be arbitrary length (recommend <10K tokens).
Assume the guide may be run from any workspace state, from an empty repo to already completely configured.
Make sure the instructions don't lead agents to overwrite existing user configuration and short-circuit steps that are already complete.
You can provide instructions to look up files, ask the user questions - anything that is necessary for your library to be fully setup and usable.
upgrade.{md|prompt}
The upgrade guide should provide guidance for upgrading from a previous version of your library to the most recent. There is no way to know the specific version being upgraded from, so the guide should be general-purpose and cover all breaking changes for the version ranges you wish to support.

Upgrade guides, like setup guides, are invoked directly.

Upgrade guides can be arbitrary length (recommend <10K tokens)
Think about prompting the agent to search for certain specific code patterns you want to address / upgrade.
docs/\*_/_.{md|prompt}
Docs provide detailed topic-based information about using your library that can be retrieved on-demand by the agent using the Dotguides read_docs MCP tool.

Docs are hierarchical (you can have nested folders). Limit top-level docs to <= 10, nesting deeper topics inside folders matching the top-level doc (e.g. .guides/docs/deployment.md and .guides/docs/deployment/provider-one.md).
Descriptions should tell agents when they should read the doc, for example: "read this to understand how to build multi-step workflows".
You can reference docs within themselves or within guides to refer the agent, for example "for more about deployment, see docs:{package_name}/deployment". Make sure to add the docs: prefix and don't add a file extension when referencing docs in your content.
commands/\*.{md|prompt}
Commands allow you to define custom slash commands that will be available in any agent that supports MCP Prompts (e.g. Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot). Commands can optionally have arguments that are passed to guide the behavior.

Commands are exposed with a package name prefix, e.g. a command called audit in a package called foo would be exposed as foo:audit.
There is no set token limit on commands, you can think of them as being step-by-step guides.
You can instruct the model to read/write files, run terminal commands, or call MCP tools that are included in your Dotguides package.
You can instruct the model to ask the user clarifying questions as needed.

Arguments are specified in frontmatter and consumed using `{{ arg_name }}` templates. Example:

---

description: a basic description of what the command does
arguments:

-   name: arg1
    description: what the argument is for
    required: true # optional, defaults to false
-   name: arg2
    description: another description

---

Arg1 Value: {{ arg1 }}
{{#if arg2}}Arg2 Value: {{arg2}}{{/if}}

Dotguides Config
The .guides/config.json provides centralized configuration for your package's Dotguides content and settings. The file has the following schema:

interface ContentConfig {
/** Identifying name of the content. \*/
name: string;
/** Concise description of the purpose of the content. _/
description?: string;
/\*\* Human-friendly title for the content. _/
title?: string;

// one of the following
/** File path relative to the .guides folder \*/
path?: string;
/** URL pointing to the content. Content of URL is expected to be plaintext. \*/
url?: string;
}

interface CommandConfig extends ContentConfig {
/\*_ Positional arguments that can be supplied to the command. _/
arguments?: {
name: string;
description?: string;
required?: boolean;
}[]
}

interface DotguidesConfig {
/** A description of the purpose of the package for dynamic discovery purposes. \*/
description?: string;
/** Configuration MCP servers that should be active while using this library. \*/
mcpServers?: Record<
string,
{ command: string; args: string[] } | { url: string }

> ;
> /** Array of guides (must have name of 'usage', 'style', 'setup', or 'upgrade'. \*/
> guides?: ContentConfig[];
> /** Array of docs definitions. _/
> docs?: ContentConfig[];
> /\*\* Array of command definitions. _/
> commands?: CommandConfig[];
> /\*_ Array of partials which can be included in .prompt templates _/
> partials?: PartialConfig[];
> }

Content that is defined in the conventional location inside the .guides folder does not need to be enumerated inside config.json.
Dotprompt Templates
Dotguides is natively integrated with Dotprompt to allow richer template logic inside of guides and documentation. Inside your templates, you can use the provided context variables and helpers to enrich your content.

To leverage Dotprompt, use the .prompt extension on your content files instead of .md.
Context Variables
Use context variables to insert metadata about the current environment into your template.

{{ @varName }} <-- use like this
{{#ifEquals @varname "someValue" }} <-- or like this

Context interface (top-level fields are @{fieldName}):

export interface RenderContext {
workspaceDir: string;
/** The actual specific exact package version installed. \*/
packageVersion: string;
/** The package version as declared in the dependency file (e.g. semver range). _/
dependencyVersion: string;
/\*\* Context about the current language, package manager, runtime, etc. _/
language: {
/** The name of the language \*/
name: string;
/** Which package manager is being used in the current workspace. _/
packageManager?: string;
/\*\* Which runtime (e.g. nodejs, bun, deno for JS) is being used. _/
runtime?: string;
/** The version of the runtime (e.g. '22.14.7' for Node.js or '1.24.2' for go). \*/
runtimeVersion?: string;
};
/** Optional information that supplies info about the current environment. _/
hints?: {
/\*\* The MCP client currently connected if known. _/
mcpClient?: { name: string; version: string };
/\*_ If the specific model being used for inference is known, it will be supplied here. _/
modelName?: string;
};
}
Helpers
Dotguides adds a number of additional helpers on top of the built-in Dotprompt helpers to provide more powerful context management:

Insert a file's content from the current workspace:
{{ workspaceFile "path/to/file.ts" }}

Insert a file's content relative to package dir:
{{ packageFile "path/to/file.md" }}

Run a command and insert the results:
{{ runCommand "echo 'hello world'" }}

Check for dep:
{{#if (hasDependency "some_package") }}
...or with semver range
{{#if (hasDependency "some_package" ">=2.0.0") }}

Check for substring match:
{{#if (contains @hints.modelName "gemini") }}
